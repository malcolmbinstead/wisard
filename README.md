# Wisard

WISARD is an early example of a hardware neural network pattern recognition machine (1981)
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAMnets#RAM-discriminators_and_WiSARD).

WISARD was designed and built by Bruce Wilkie
at Brunel University as part of his Phd project
with the backing of Professor Igor Aleksander
and Dr John Stonham.

WISARD was a hardware machine that used a
parallel architecture to run at video frame rates.

WISARD is on display at the Science Museum
in the Winton Gallery (https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/learning/mathematics-winton-gallery-school-info).

This project is a software implementation of WISARD that performs the processing steps within your browser.

This implementation is written in Typescript as an Angular 7 service.

This implementation uses WebGL2 and the Shading Language to accelerate the processing pipeline.

This demonstration uses a SPA (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) top-level application to walk you through WISARD's processing steps.

A runnable demo can be found at:

And the source code can be found at:

Please note that this demo requires that you are using a browser and display card that supports webgl2.
